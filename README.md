# Stock_Market_App
Stock market web app designed to learn about web tools, data manipulation and using iterative charts.

In addition, I forecast the Ibovespa, S&P500 and Bitcoin indices, using the basic data provided by yfinance, using the Random Forest Regressor model and tuning with GridSearchCV.
